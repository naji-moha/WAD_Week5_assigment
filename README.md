Week 5 Assignment: React To-Do App with Firebase Authentication

Project Overview

This project is a React-based To-Do List App with user authentication through Firebase. Users can sign up, log in, and manage tasks efficiently.

Key Features
User Authentication: Firebase authentication for user sign-up and login.
Task Management: Add, edit, and delete tasks with local storage support.
Persistent Data: Tasks remain saved even after a page refresh using Local Storage.
Responsive Design: Optimized for different screen sizes.
Routing: Implemented with React Router for navigation between login, signup, and to-do pages.

Setup Instructions
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
Node.js (LTS version recommended)
npm or yarn
A Firebase project set up
Installation Steps
Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
Install dependencies:
npm install
Set up Firebase:
Create a Firebase project at Firebase Console.
Enable Authentication (Email/Password method).
Copy your Firebase config and replace the placeholders in firebase.js:
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-auth-domain",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket",
  messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};

Run the application:
npm run dev

Key Learnings:
React Router: Learned how to handle navigation and redirects.
Firebase Authentication: Implemented user sign-up and login functionality.
Local Storage: Used local storage to persist tasks even after a page reload.
State Management: Developed a stronger grasp of useState and useEffect hooks.

Technical Challenges:
Authentication Redirection: Redirecting users correctly after signing in or signing up.
Persistent State: Handling local storage updates in a way that was efficient and didn't affect performance.
Error Handling: Handling Firebase authentication errors, for example, invalid passwords or duplicate accounts.
Component Structure: Organizing React components in a proper structure for reusability and maintainability.

Conclusion
The assignment helped to improve hands-on skills with React, Firebase authentication, and effective managing state.  
The project is now fully functional, and feedback is welcome!
